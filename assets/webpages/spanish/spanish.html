            Spanish cuisine is heavily influenced by historical processes that shaped local culture and 
            society in some of Europe's Iberian Peninsula territories. Geography and climate have had a 
            great influence on cooking methods and available ingredients. These cooking methods and ingredients 
            are still present in the gastronomy of the various regions that make up Spain. Spanish cuisine 
            derives from a complex history where invasions and conquests of Spain have modified traditions 
            which made new ingredients available. Thus, the current and old cuisine of Spain incorporates old and new traditions.
